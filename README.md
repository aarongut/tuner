# HTML + JavaScript instrument tuner
---
## What
A simple webapp that listens to your microphone, figures out what note you are trying to play, and
tells you if that note is in tune.

## Why
  - All the free instrument tuner apps seem to have ads
  - Fast Fourier Transforms seemed interesting
  - I was bored

## How
This makes use of the Web Audio API's
[`AnalyserNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode). I figured all the
bits and pieces out following this [MDN
tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API)
